Time Complexity: how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.

O(1) = Constant Time 
O(log n) = takes log n unit of time
O(n) = takes n unit of time
O(n log n) = takes n log n unit of time
O(n^2) = takes n^2 unit of time
O(2^n) = takes 2^n unit of time
O(n!) = takes n! unit of time
